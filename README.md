# Time Series Forecasting with Python
Time series forecasting is the process of using historical data to predict future values of a time-dependent variable. This type of forecasting is based on the idea that past behavior and trends in the data can be used to make educated guesses about future values.

Many disciplines, such as finance, public administration, energy, retail, and healthcare, are dominated by time-series data. Large areas of micro- and macroeconomics rely on applied statistics with an emphasis on time-series analyses and modeling. The following are examples of time-series data:

- Daily closing values of a stock index
- Number of weekly infections of a disease
- Weekly series of train accidents
- Rainfall per day
- Sensor data such as temperature measurements per hour
- Population growth per year
- Quarterly earnings of a company over a number of years
